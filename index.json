Recently for another project, I trained a CNN to classify the objects being grasped by a hand which has GelSight based tactile sensors. It worked pretty good (~90% accuracy) on my test objects. Analysing the false classifications indicated that the tactile data may not be perfect during all the grasps. We humans also gets confused in the same way occasionally, if we grab objects with just two fingers. We would then either proceed to close the fingers to make more contact surface area with the object or roll the object between our fingers to classify it. This would then give us more data and increases our belief probability.\nPrevious Works Much research has been done in tactile object recognition as well as in hand manipulation [1], [2]. Unlike those approaches. this work explores on learning a finger movement repertoire, that could maximize the in-hand object recognition/localization capabilities.\nStatus The following video shows the prototype gripper classifying two test objects (geodesic spheres with hexagonal and triangular faces, that can be better felt by touch)\n We can see that it falsely classifies objects once in a while.\nA modular 3rd axis is inserted in between the finger and the gripper, which can rotate the object in hand.\n The classification probabilities during this motion are averaged to get a more accurate estimate of the object.\n(Note: it has been tested only with symmetric objects, which are easy to roll and is still an ongoing project)\nGoing Further More experimentation, 3D reconstruction using techniques using ICP.\n ","date":1605398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605398400,"objectID":"62d0046664c3460d52ddf9e988fb174e","permalink":"https://achuwilson.github.io/project/2020-in-hand-rolling/","publishdate":"2020-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2020-in-hand-rolling/","section":"project","summary":"In-Hand manipulation for better tactile object detection and shape reconstruction.","tags":["software","wip"],"title":"In-Hand Rolling","type":"project"},{"authors":["Radhen Patel","Rui Ouyang","Branden Romero","Achu Wilson","Edward Adelson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604793600,"objectID":"a3c89030254097864288f7eb7fbec312","permalink":"https://achuwilson.github.io/publication/2020-digger/","publishdate":"2020-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-digger/","section":"publication","summary":" This paper proposes a tactile sensorized gripper for digging into granular media (will be updated soon)","tags":null,"title":"Digger Finger: GelSight for Granular Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Software Projects"],"content":"  What and why  Previous works  How  Status  What and Why BlindGrasp, as the name implies, aims at grasping objects when the robot\u0026rsquo;s eyes are blindfolded. This idea had been lingering in my mind, ever since I came across the GelSight optical tactile sensor. It is a tough and challenging problem and I have been making slow, yet good progress. This is the main project that I am spending my time now and has helped us to be the finalist in the Kuka Innovation Award 2021\nHumans have excellent grasping capabilities in unstructured environments which are still unmatched by robots. This can be attributed to the dexterous human hand, robust visual and tactile sensing capabilities as well as to the intelligent brain which makes conscious and subconscious decisions.\nVisual sensing is traditionally used extensively in robotics when compared to tactile sensing. Tactile sensing is harder, mainly due to the difficulty in interpreting and making sense of the complex tactile signals. The recent developments in machine learning - particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning has opened new possibilities in the making usage of such complex data.\nWe humans can effortlessly put a hand inside a bag, search by moving it around and pick up an item or we can use our hands to dig or sieve through granular medium like sand and pick up an object. This project explores building a system which learns manipulation and grasping skills in such vision denied environments.\nPrevious Works Grasping objects, using tactile sensing alone as well as in granular media are explored more recently. Following are some of the early works.\n  Reactive Grasping Using Optical Proximity Sensors by Kaijen Hsaio et al.  A Deep Learning Approach to Grasping the Invisible, by Yang Yang et al.  Vibro-Tactile Foreign Body Detection in Granular Objects based on Squeeze-Induced Mechanical Vibrations by Togzhan Syrymova et al.  MAT: Multi-Fingered Adaptive Tactile Grasping via Deep Reinforcement Learning by Bohan Wu et al.  Learning to Grasp without Seeing by Adithyavairavan Murali et al.  Multimodal Haptic Perception within Granular Media via Recurrent Neural Networks by S.Jia et al.  There are almost no works combining tactile sensing- exploration and grasping objects in granular media\nHow Bringing such novel manipulation capabilities to robots calls for better robot hands as well as algorithms. The stated goals of the project are\n Building a novel tactile sensing capable gripper Develop AI techniques to make the robot learn how to explore, detect and grasp objects in unstructured-vision denied environments where tactile sensing only could be used.  The Tactile Sensing Gripper consists of a two finger parallel jaw gripper, with tactile sensing capabilities. Similar to the human fingers, the inner surface of the fingers would be having a high spatial resolution tactile sensing capability and the outer surface comparatively lower resolution. The highly sensitive inner surface of the finger helps in recognizing objects from their shape, texture as well as in fine manipulation skills. The lower sensitive outer surface helps in detecting the presence of nearby objects via contact.\nThe AI System consists of a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent that learns how to explore the environment and to recognize/differentiate objects and pick them up. The agent uses data from the two types of tactile sensors on each of the fingers, proprioception and force sensor data from the robot arm. The agent decides the direction of motion of the end effector and the control of the gripper.\nAs a relatively simple task to start with, grasping specific objects from an environment similar to the following setup will have to be acheived using the tactile sensing alone.\nUltimately, the robot is expected to learn how to pick up objects under the granular media as in the following simulation.\n  Status A novel gripper, with tactile sensing around the finger is built and we are collecting data from the real world environment. This would be augmented with data from the simulated environment and human demonstrations to train the RL agent for the task.\nMore updates coming soon, as it is an ongoing project..!\n ","date":1595808000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595808000,"objectID":"68c1814dc9ba1cf757693b50cf469717","permalink":"https://achuwilson.github.io/project/2020-blindgrasp/","publishdate":"2020-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2020-blindgrasp/","section":"project","summary":"Grasping in vision denied environments using Tactile Sensing.","tags":["software","wip"],"title":"BlindGrasp","type":"project"},{"authors":["alison","Desirée De Leon"],"categories":["talk"],"content":" This webinar was designed to help educators who needed to quickly transition to remote teaching due to COVID-19.\n Educators create a lot of files for teaching- slides, exercises, solutions, assignments, data, figures- that all ultimately need to be shared with other people.

It was introduced by Asada et al as early as early 80s [1], [2]. Direct drive robots have many inherent advantages like better torque control, dynamic response, zero backlash and friction etc. Despite all these advantages, the main disadvantage that prevented direct drive robots from becoming mainstream is mainly the low torque density of electrical motors. However, recent advancements in technology has brought us high torque BLDC motors, which are used either used directly or in combination with a low gear ratio (\u0026lt;10) reducer.

Recent works exploring learning based solutions have shown promising results on robotic manipulation tasks. One efficient approach for training such learning agents is to train them within a simulated environment, followed by their deployment on real robots (Sim2Real). Most current works leverage camera vision to facilitate such manipulation tasks. However, camera vision might be significantly occluded by robot hands during the manipulation. Tactile sensing is another important sensing modality that offers complementary information to vision and can make up the information loss caused by the occlusion. However, the use of tactile sensing is restricted in the Sim2Real research due to no simulated tactile sensors available in the current simulation platforms. To mitigate the gap, we introduce a novel approach for simulating a GelSight tactile sensor in the commonly used Gazebo simulator. Similar to the real GelSight sensor, the simulated sensor can produce high-resolution images by an optical sensor from the interaction between the touched object and an opaque soft membrane. It can indirectly sense forces, geometry, texture and other properties of the object and enables the research of Sim2Real learning with tactile sensing.

The deformable elastomer has colored markers on its outer surface, which is then tracked by a wide angle camera placed at one end of the glass tube. The camera is able to get a 360 degree image of the surface of the finger, which is then de-warped to rectangular images for better understanding and processing. The other end of the tube has a spherical mirror. The reflected image of the markers from the spherical mirror provides view from another angle and is intended to be used in future to reconstruct the three dimensional position of the markers using stereo reconstruction.\nUsing off the shelf components ensured that the cost of the modular tactile finger is kept low. A 75 x 12 mm laboratory test tube is used as the cylindrical tube. The elastomer has Shore A hardness of 15 and is made using high transparent platinum cure silicone, which is molded into a thin sheet and wrapped over the test tube. The parabolic mirror is made using a chrome coated metal ball bearing. The finger is compatible with commonly available webcams and better results were obtained using a wide angle Raspberry Pi Camera.\nA two finger parallel gripper configuration can be easily achieved using such a finger Status The following image shows the raw output from the camera and then it is pre-processed and the dots are tracked for its position Going Further The next steps would be attaching it to a gripper and collecting real world data.\nSubsequent Works These are some subsequent works by others and could be references for future works.\n  GelTip: A Finger-shaped Optical Tactile Sensor for Robotic Manipulation by Daniel Gomes et al.

In 1942 US Air Force played with kittens in microgravity. The same lab, in 1962, published a report titled Weightless Man: Self-Rotation Techniques, as a guidline for future astronauts on how to move around in zero gravity. 1960s. The falling cat was also studiedextensively by NASA to prepare the astronauts for Zero-G environments. A 1969 paper titled A Dynamical Explanation of the Falling Cat Phenomenon explains this.\nPast research attributes the cat reflex to law of conservation of momentem. Flexible bodies can generate internal forces and moments, by the motion of limbs. But the rest of the body rotates in opposite direction owing to the conservation of momentum, so that net angular momentum remains zero. However the rate of rotation can be controlled by extending or pulling back the limbs. Wikipedia summarises it to three key steps:\n1.Bend in the middle so that the front half of their body rotates about a different axis from the rear half. 2.Tuck their front legs in to reduce the moment of inertia of the front half of their body and extend their rear legs to increase the moment of inertia of the rear half of their body so that they can rotate their front further (as much as 90°) while the rear half rotates in the opposite direction less (as little as 10°). 3.Extend their front legs and tuck their rear legs so that they can rotate their rear half further while their front half rotates in the opposite direction less.\nDepending on the cat’s flexibility and initial angular momentum, if any, the cat may need to perform steps two and three repeatedly in order to complete a full 180° rotation.\nPast works on using active spine in legged robots specialized rotation in the axis perpendicular to the saggital plane and was aimed at improving the gait. My research focusess on rotation in the axis perpendicular to the transverse plane. I developed an inertial reoreintation controller. It controls the extension and tucking in of the quadruped limbs, so that the cranial and caudal part rotates with different velocities owing to the conserved momentum. The controller thus uses the inertia of the quadruped to reorient itself.\nResults A quadruped was modelled in the Bullet simulator and a simple state machine based controller was implemented. It works beautifully as in the following video\n  Status As the system is verified in simulation, now it has to be implemented in hardware. I am working on a small quadruped during freetime and it will be updated later.\nHere are some photos of it in progress.\n References will be updated later as time permits.\n ","date":1495843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495843200,"objectID":"50e4e25118a8cffba198e69dcda79c32","permalink":"https://achuwilson.github.io/project/2017-activespine_quadruped/","publishdate":"2017-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2017-activespine_quadruped/","section":"project","summary":"Mid air inertial re-orientation using an active spine","tags":["software"],"title":"Quadruped with Active spine","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Hardware Projects"],"content":"   What and why\n   Result\n  What and Why This work proposes a Magneto Rheological linear clutch for use in human safe robotic applications.
