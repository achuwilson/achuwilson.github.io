We make use of the properties of the object as well as the environment to push, flip, throw and squeeze objects.\nThe following video shows a human hand pushing a paper box on a table and pivoting it around an edge. We can do such a task just by relying on the forces felt on the finger.\nThe MIT 6.881 Manipulation class Fall 2020, which was offered entirely online, had a class project and I decided to try this. A Kuka LBR iiwa robot, fitted with a simple single finger end effector is used to achieve the task. The robot does not have the model of the object nor the environment (No prior knowledge of the dimensions of the box or the position coordinates of the edge). The workspace limitations of the robot restrict moving the object under the table, but the method could be extended for any such capable robot.\nHow    Since the model of the object and environment is not provided and no external vision sensors are used, proprioceptive data alone is to be used. The joint torques and position from the robot are used in combination with the impedance control capabilities of the iiwa to estimate the model parameters. This would be an almost impossible or incredibly difficult task with a conventional position-controlled stiff robot, even if equipped with a Force/Torque sensor. The entire system is implemented in Drake as a state machine. The following paragraphs detail the approach used.\nInitially, the robot moves at a constant velocity in the negative z-axis. Individual joint velocities are calculated from the desired velocity using a PsuedoInverseJacobian controller. Since the iiwa does not have a joint velocity input, the computed joint velocities are integrated to obtain the joint position inputs. While the robot is moving at such a constant velocity, the force on the end effector is being monitored. IIWA provides joint torques estimated at the 7 joints. The external wrench at the end effector is calculated using the PsuedoInverseJacobian method. When the z-axis force is above an experimentally determined threshold, the state machine jumps into the next state.\nOnce the finger touches the box, it applies a downward force and a forward velocity such that the resultant force is outside the friction cone of the contact between the box and table. Since the friction coefficient is unknown, the forces are determined experimentally.\nThe Drake Kuka driver allows us to provide a feedforward torque to each joint. The individual feedforward torque values are calculated from the desired end-effector wrench using the Jacobian transpose methods and commanded.\nAs the finger approaches the edge of the table, interesting things start to happen.\nAs the center of gravity moves past the edge, the gravitational force acting on it causes a torque centered around the edge. This torque generates an upwards force on the fingers (green up arrows). Since the iiwa operates in impedance control mode, it is not very stiff in the z-axis. So, it deviates minutely from the previous positions in the vertical direction, moving in an arc centered around the corner. The derivative of z-axis force is used to detect the beginning of this deviation and is used to transition the state machine to the next state.\nOnce the box starts pivoting, the finger continues moving in the x-axis, until the vertical z-axis reaction force generated by the box on the finger is zero. The gravitational force on the object would be balanced by the horizontal component of the forces on the finger and the corner. The motion of the finger is stopped and any incremental motion will cause the object to fall.\nThe following plot shows the z axis finger coordinates during this time and we can clearly see the arc.\nThe following graph shows the forces and their derivatives on the finger until the box is balanced between the finger and the corner (T3).\n From 0 to T1, the finger moves down at the constant velocity. The force readings are quite noisy when the finger is not in contact with anything and the accuracy is only +/-5N. The spike at T1 is caused by contact with the object. From T1 to T2, The finger moves towards the edge, applying a constant force in the z-axis. At T2, the box starts pivoting due to torque induced by gravity. the derivative of the force is found to be a reliable estimate to detect this rather than the raw noisy force data. From T1 to T3, the z-axis force peaks and then drops. It is this force that causes the compliant z-axis to deviate in position and move in an arc, which is shown in the plot of pZ (z-axis position). At T3, the box is balanced perfectly between the finger and the corner. The force on the z-axis drops while the x-axis force increases. The motion of the finger is stopped at this point.  The points on the arc are observed and fitted onto a model of the circle to estimate the model parameters: the position coordinate of the corner and the size of the object.\nOnce we estimate the center and radius from the arc, we plan a trajectory along the perimeter, starting from the current finger position and finishing at a position when the box is vertical.\nThe trajectory includes the positions of each frame (blue dots) as well as the forces (green arrows) at all these frames. This makes sure that while pivoting, the vector sum of forces direct towards the corner position.\nThe robot then moves along the trajectory. Once the finger reaches the end of the above trajectory, a new trajectory is planned, along the same path to pivot the box back to the horizontal position. While executing this new trajectory, fingers move along the circular path, with tangential velocity and radial force components.\nOnce the box is nearly vertical, the state machine transitions into a new state, in which the finger moves a little up or down to maintain a pre-determined vertical force on the box. This accounts for the accumulated position errors caused during the estimation of the model parameters. Once it is done, the state machine transitions it to the final state where the finger moves horizontally, moving the box to the initial position.\nResults    The following video (3x sped up) shows the system in action.\n  \nThe approach works reliably and is tested with boxes of different sizes and weights as well as for different table positions.\nThe following areas could be improved for better performance.\n The system cannot detect the slip that might occur. A tactile sensorized finger (GelSight?) could be used for this. The joint torques reported by iiwa are not very accurate and are also pose dependant. This could be improved using an external F/T sensor. The estimated model may not be always perfectly accurate. The inaccuracy in the estimated edge position causes a jerking motion when we start applying force towards the center. The finger position not only depends on the commanded position but the feed-forward torque also, this makes the transition between feed-forward torque control mode and trajectory execution mode tricky and causes little jerks.

The best example would be geodesic polyhedrons of different frequencies, which can trick visual - both color and depth systems as follows.\n.\nThe surface geometry of the object could be estimated using a robot gripper which has a GelSight sensor. A CNN using MobileNet architecture was trained to classify the objectsfrom the raw GelSight data. It worked pretty good (~90% accuracy) on the test objects. Analyzing the false classifications indicated that the tactile data may not be perfect during all the grasps. We humans also gets confused in the same way occasionally, if we grab objects with just two fingers. We would then either proceed to close the fingers to make more contact surface area with the object or roll the object between our fingers as in the following video to classify it.\nThis would then give us more tactile data and increases our belief probability. This work involves exploring whether such a capability can improve tactile sensing for robots.\nPrevious Works    Much research has been done in tactile object recognition as well as in hand manipulation [1], [2].

This idea had been lingering in my mind, ever since I came across the GelSight optical tactile sensor. It is a tough and challenging problem and I have been making slow, yet good progress. This is the main project that I am spending my time now and has helped us to be the finalist in the Kuka Innovation Award 2021\nHumans have excellent grasping capabilities in unstructured environments which are still unmatched by robots. This can be attributed to the dexterous human hand, robust visual and tactile sensing capabilities as well as to the intelligent brain which makes conscious and subconscious decisions.\nVisual sensing is traditionally used extensively in robotics when compared to tactile sensing. Tactile sensing is harder, mainly due to the difficulty in interpreting and making sense of the complex tactile signals. The recent developments in machine learning - particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning has opened new possibilities in the making usage of such complex data.\nWe humans can effortlessly put a hand inside a bag, search by moving it around and pick up an item or we can use our hands to dig or sieve through granular medium like sand and pick up an object. This project explores building a system which learns manipulation and grasping skills in such vision denied environments.\nPrevious Works    Grasping objects, using tactile sensing alone as well as in granular media are explored more recently. Following are some of the early works.\n  Reactive Grasping Using Optical Proximity Sensors by Kaijen Hsaio et al.  A Deep Learning Approach to Grasping the Invisible, by Yang Yang et al.  Vibro-Tactile Foreign Body Detection in Granular Objects based on Squeeze-Induced Mechanical Vibrations by Togzhan Syrymova et al.  MAT: Multi-Fingered Adaptive Tactile Grasping via Deep Reinforcement Learning by Bohan Wu et al.  Learning to Grasp without Seeing by Adithyavairavan Murali et al.  Multimodal Haptic Perception within Granular Media via Recurrent Neural Networks by S.Jia et al.  There are almost no works combining tactile sensing- exploration and grasping objects in granular media\nHow    Bringing such novel manipulation capabilities to robots calls for better robot hands as well as algorithms. The stated goals of the project are\n Building a novel tactile sensing capable gripper Develop AI techniques to make the robot learn how to explore, detect and grasp objects in unstructured-vision denied environments where tactile sensing only could be used.  The Tactile Sensing Gripper consists of a two finger parallel jaw gripper, with tactile sensing capabilities. Similar to the human fingers, the inner surface of the fingers would be having a high spatial resolution tactile sensing capability and the outer surface comparatively lower resolution. The highly sensitive inner surface of the finger helps in recognizing objects from their shape, texture as well as in fine manipulation skills. The lower sensitive outer surface helps in detecting the presence of nearby objects via contact.\nThe AI System consists of a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent that learns how to explore the environment and to recognize/differentiate objects and pick them up. The agent uses data from the two types of tactile sensors on each of the fingers, proprioception and force sensor data from the robot arm. The agent decides the direction of motion of the end effector and the control of the gripper.\nAs a relatively simple task to start with, grasping specific objects from an environment similar to the following setup will have to be acheived using the tactile sensing alone.\nUltimately, the robot is expected to learn how to pick up objects under the granular media as in the following simulation.\n  Status    A novel gripper, with tactile sensing around the finger is built and we are collecting data from the real world environment. This would be augmented with data from the simulated environment and human demonstrations to train the RL agent for the task.\nMore updates coming soon, as it is an ongoing project..!\n ","date":1595808000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595808000,"objectID":"68c1814dc9ba1cf757693b50cf469717","permalink":"https://achuwilson.github.io/project/2020-blindgrasp/","publishdate":"2020-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2020-blindgrasp/","section":"project","summary":"Grasping in vision denied environments using Tactile Sensing.","tags":["software","wip"],"title":"BlindGrasp","type":"project"},{"authors":["alison","Desirée De Leon"],"categories":["talk"],"content":" This webinar was designed to help educators who needed to quickly transition to remote teaching due to COVID-19.\n Educators create a lot of files for teaching- slides, exercises, solutions, assignments, data, figures- that all ultimately need to be shared with other people.

It was introduced by Asada et al as early as early 80s [1], [2]. Direct drive robots have many inherent advantages like better torque control, dynamic response, zero backlash and friction etc. Despite all these advantages, the main disadvantage that prevented direct drive robots from becoming mainstream is mainly the low torque density of electrical motors. However, recent advancements in technology has brought us high torque BLDC motors, which are used either used directly or in combination with a low gear ratio (\u0026lt;10) reducer.

Recent works exploring learning based solutions have shown promising results on robotic manipulation tasks. One efficient approach for training such learning agents is to train them within a simulated environment, followed by their deployment on real robots (Sim2Real). Most current works leverage camera vision to facilitate such manipulation tasks. However, camera vision might be significantly occluded by robot hands during the manipulation. Tactile sensing is another important sensing modality that offers complementary information to vision and can make up the information loss caused by the occlusion. However, the use of tactile sensing is restricted in the Sim2Real research due to no simulated tactile sensors available in the current simulation platforms. To mitigate the gap, we introduce a novel approach for simulating a GelSight tactile sensor in the commonly used Gazebo simulator. Similar to the real GelSight sensor, the simulated sensor can produce high-resolution images by an optical sensor from the interaction between the touched object and an opaque soft membrane. It can indirectly sense forces, geometry, texture and other properties of the object and enables the research of Sim2Real learning with tactile sensing.

This is owing to their simplicity in design, control and better contact surface area, thereby giving a better grip.\nHowever, human fingers are round and more streamlined.

In addition, the tactile sensing capability all around the human finger surface helps in making better sense of the environment contacts.\nPrevious Works    #to be update later\nWhat makes it special     Round the surface tactile sensing Simple construction Cheap and affordable  The cross sectional view of the finger is as shown below It consists of a cylindrical glass tube coated with a layer of transparent silicone elastomer. The deformable elastomer has colored markers on its outer surface, which is then tracked by a wide angle camera placed at one end of the glass tube. The camera is able to get a 360 degree image of the surface of the finger, which is then de-warped to rectangular images for better understanding and processing. The other end of the tube has a spherical mirror. The reflected image of the markers from the spherical mirror provides view from another angle and is intended to be used in future to reconstruct the three dimensional position of the markers using stereo reconstruction.\nUsing off the shelf components ensured that the cost of the modular tactile finger is kept low. A 75 x 12 mm laboratory test tube is used as the cylindrical tube. The elastomer has Shore A hardness of 15 and is made using high transparent platinum cure silicone, which is molded into a thin sheet and wrapped over the test tube. The parabolic mirror is made using a chrome coated metal ball bearing. The finger is compatible with commonly available webcams and better results were obtained using a wide angle Raspberry Pi Camera.\nA two finger parallel gripper configuration can be easily achieved using such a finger Status    The following image shows the raw output from the camera and then it is pre-processed and the dots are tracked for its position Going Further    The next steps would be attaching it to a gripper and collecting real world data.\nSubsequent Works    These are some subsequent works by others and could be references for future works.\n  GelTip: A Finger-shaped Optical Tactile Sensor for Robotic Manipulation by Daniel Gomes et al.

I was so much inspired after seeing all the research being published there. I decided pursue a research project, and try to publish a paper in the subsequent conference. The fact that ICRA 2017 is organized in Singapore was also another major factor. It is close to India and I need not spend a fortune on the travel and accommodation expenses.\nWhy I did it?     I always wanted to become a scientist and make my little contribution to science/robotics. I wanted to get into a Ph.D program and I had no research papers. To experience how it was like doing research and writing a technical paper. Attend conferences like ICRA and IROS again, meet smart people and their work.  My Background and Constraints    Ever since I was rejected from a couple of Ph.D programs from 2013-2015, due to lack of research experience, I have been making plans and trying to do research on my own and write a couple of papers. But nothing moved past making elaborate plans and maybe a little literature study for all the research ideas I had. The stresses of working in a startup consume so much of your mental strength as well as time. Thus I failed in materializing all my research Ideas. My research ideas are interdisciplinary and spans over computer vision for robotics, novel actuators for robots, robotic manipulators and motion planning to name a few.\nMy constraints are:\n  Demanding Job: Working in a startup is very much different that a normal 9-5 job. You have got multiple responsibilities and more work. On some days I may have to pull all-nighters to meet the deadlines\n  No research experience : Even though I always wanted to be a scientist, I never had any formal training in research. I am mostly a self taught engineer and all my prior works were on building and hacking some stuff.\n  No mentor : Wish I had some professors to guide me. I was alone and my guide was the books and the Internet.\n  Limited Time : Since one of the goals of undertaking a research project is going to the next ICRA, I had to submit the paper before 15th September 2016. So, it is barely three and half months.\n  Picking up a research topic    The first challenge was picking up the topic or project to work on. I was clueless and was interested in everything. I started reading through the notes and photos I took at ICRA16. Finally I ended up in the best way possible. The proceedings of the conference were given on a USB drive. It was the first time I had access to this much research papers. It was awesome to go through all of the papers, even though I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand many of the purely theoretical ones.\nNow I had to read through all of them, make notes and think how to build upon that. Finding time to read all these was the first problem I faced. I cannot sit and read the entire day. I started using Mendeley app on PC and my smartphone to organize the papers and make notes. Having all the papers in my smartphone helped to make use of every bit of time otherwise spent useless. I read during my daily commute to and from work, during meals, when I am travelling outside etc\nIt was very difficult to indulge in studies and research during this time. I was travelling for client demos of the startup and staying at different places- with friends, relatives, in hotels etc. Moreover, I would be often exhausted after the day\u0026rsquo;s toil, that even the possibility of staying up late reading was not imaginable. Still, I managed to read quite a bit by making best usage of time and not wasting any. Often I would end up sleeping reading some papers on my smartphone or in front of the open laptop.\nEven though finding time to read was difficult, there was enough and more time to think. I could think while waiting in traffic blocks, while driving, during meals, and even during boring and useless meetings. My thoughts wandered around various problems associated with direct drive mechanisms and technologies, how animal muscles work and limbs move, tactile and vision feedback, power consumption for these drives etc to name a few.\nI had to travel to Chennai for supporting a custome/pdf/2017-mr-clutch-icra.pdfr of my company. I stayed with my relatives in Chennai and the daily commute to the client was about 70 kms. I was traveling in the crowded suburban trains of Chennai and the hot climate made it worse. I had to start my journey at about 8 AM and would be back only by 11PM. I would be very exhausted by the time I reached back to my room. So reading at night was beyond consideration. But I could make use of the commute time. In total, it took around 7 hours an average per day for my commute. I spend this time reading through the papers that came in the ICRA USB drive. There were over a thousand papers in my reading list. I skimmed through most of them, stopping and reading only those portions I could understand or was interested in. I came across the paper titled \u0026quot; Design and Development of a Hybrid Magneto-Rheological Clutch for Safe Robotic Applications\u0026quot; by Masoud Moghani and Mehrdad R. Kermani. It captured my attention and I began to study more about Magneto-Rheological fluids and their application in human safe robotics. I found out a couple more papers by the same authors on the fundamentals of MR devices.\nInitial explorations, failures    More experimentation, finalizing the idea    Once I was back at home, I began to delve deep into MR Fluids and their characterization. More reading\u0026hellip; More searching.. I came up with an idea to make use of the properties of MR Fluid to make a Linear clutch - a clutch which controls force transmitted from input to output through MR fluid.\nMR fluids are expensive and the lead-time will be a couple of weeks. Since I cannot afford both, I resorted to making my own MR fluid. I filed myself a piece of iron to the fine powdered form and used vegetable oil as the medium to make my own MR fluid for the prototype. Here is a small video with the MR fluid\n  Before starting on the construction, I verified that my concept works in simulation. The following figures show the CAD model, rendered image and the FEM analysis\nAfter that I started working on building the MR clutch. Following photos shows some random shots during the build process.\nNow I have to procure a couple of items which includes linear shaft bearings, aluminum rods etc. Once all the parts are procured, the clutch was assembled and the cavity inside was filled with MR Fluid. Then it had to be tested and characteristics were studied\n  In order to demonstrate the usefulness and study more about the MR linear clutch, a single degree of freedom robot joint was designed and fabricated. It used the standard 30x30 Aluminum profiles. The arm was driven by a Firgelli linear actuator.\n/pdf/2017-mr-clutch-icra.pdf\nMore experiments are done with the arm to validate the functionality of MR Linear clutch.\n  Documentation    Experiments are completed and data collected. Now I have to write the paper. Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any previous experience writing an academic paper, it took some time. I read a couple of articles online and referred IEEE guides and instructions. Instead of starting with the abstract and introduction, I started directly with the content- the things I did and the results obtained. Once it was done, I had to refer more literature to write the introductory pages. Luckily, due to the local festival of Onam, I got holidays for a couple of days and could work on the paper full time. Even then, I could felt the time running out fast. I had to plot the graphs, make diagrams and pictures and it took a lot more time than expected. I worked on the paper for about 4days clocking about 20 hours of work daily. Just a couple of hours before the deadline, I completed the final proofreading and submitted the paper. I was so exhausted after this that I literally slept an entire day after this.\nThe final version of the paper is available here\nAcceptance and Presentation at ICRA 2017    No words could describe the joy and happiness I had when I got the decision in January 2017. My very first paper was accepted. I began preparing for attending the conference.\nLater, I travelled to Singapore to attend ICRA 2017, where I presented my paper. In addition, I got to meet numerous researchers and even get an a copy of Handbook of Robotics signed by Dr. Oussama Khatib Key Takeaways    It was an awesome experience. I pushed myself to the limits, learned a lot of things.\nWhen I started working on the research project, the only thing that mattered to me was doing such an awesome work so that it is accepted at a top conference like ICRA. But as I finished the paper, I realized that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter much whether the paper is accepted or rejected. The only thing that matters is how much impactful is your work and how much satisfied you are.\nAlong the course of working on the paper, I learned much beyond the robotics stuff. The main ones being\n  Time Management :\nIn most cases, scientific research and publication of results take an enormous amount of time and resources. It may takes months or even years of research to make an impactful invention and maybe even more months to author a paper on it. But in my case, the time was fixed as the paper was to be submitted before the deadline, which is just a couple of months away. On top of that, I am working a full-time job at a startup, which made finding the time extremely difficult. I had to find extra time after my work and make the best use of time wasted. I often slept less, only about 4-5 hours a day. After my daytime job, I started fiddling with the research projects in the evening and continued till midnight or occassionally to early mornings.\nHaving a smartphone always with me was the greatest tool that I used to make best use of time. It was loaded with plenty of books and papers. I had Mendeley on my phone to keep track of all the papers that I am reading. I could read on the phone irrespective of where I am - while traveling in a crowded bus, when having meals, when having a haircut at the salon, when stuck in a traffic jam, while waiting for someone, when in a queue or even when I am in the toilet seat. These are the bits of time wasted by not being productive. Somehow I managed to squeeze out every bit of time wasted and use it for productive things.\n  Narrow down and Focus :\nMy initial ideas was to design a clone of MIT Cheetah using direct drive actuators which is a very broad topic. Studies must be done on the actuators, optimum kinematic structure, gait generation, stability and much more. Each of these requires considerable research effort in itself and has only been possible by the collective effort of many researchers. So concentrate on something that may seem simple and small, go deep and push forward.\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t re-invent the wheel : This was a lesson that I learned the hard way. Better not to start from scratch, unless your idea is revolutionary and novel. Study about and make use of the progress brought about by past researchers. If some part of your research depends on something that has been previously done, make use of it and build upon it or reuse it. Your time is limited (not just the conference submission deadline), so why to spend time reinventing the wheel, when you can invest it to invent time travel.\n  You cannot plan a research project explicitly : Coming from a background doing engineering projects, I used to plan all the minute details and had a roadmap for execution. I knew beforehand the progress I would achieve at particular instances of time. It was possible because the path was clear and the results was predictable. Engineering is the often trodden path and research is the one less traveled. You may just know the direction but you have to make the path. You may be struck with an idea when you least expect it. The results of the research may often come unexpectedly and maybe even in dreams like the discovery structure of Benzene by Kekule. So in short Engineering = predictable ,while Research = unpredictable.\n  ","date":1497484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497484800,"objectID":"26c4e7524eea311da26ea3e12efb8583","permalink":"https://achuwilson.github.io/post/2017-06-15-icra17/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-06-15-icra17/","section":"post","summary":"Doing an independent research on my own and publishing my first paper at ICRA-17.","tags":["robotics","conference"],"title":"Publishing my first Paper","type":"post"},{"authors":["Achu Wilson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"bff335706a87730ac270d47ddb417914","permalink":"https://achuwilson.github.io/publication/2017-magnetorheological-clutch/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-magnetorheological-clutch/","section":"publication","summary":" This paper proposes a Magneto Rheological linear clutch  for  use  in  human  safe  robotic  applications.

In 1942 US Air Force played with kittens in microgravity. The same lab, in 1962, published a report titled Weightless Man: Self-Rotation Techniques, as a guidline for future astronauts on how to move around in zero gravity. 1960s. The falling cat was also studiedextensively by NASA to prepare the astronauts for Zero-G environments. A 1969 paper titled A Dynamical Explanation of the Falling Cat Phenomenon explains this.\nPast research attributes the cat reflex to law of conservation of momentem. Flexible bodies can generate internal forces and moments, by the motion of limbs. But the rest of the body rotates in opposite direction owing to the conservation of momentum, so that net angular momentum remains zero. However the rate of rotation can be controlled by extending or pulling back the limbs. Wikipedia summarises it to three key steps:\n1.Bend in the middle so that the front half of their body rotates about a different axis from the rear half. 2.Tuck their front legs in to reduce the moment of inertia of the front half of their body and extend their rear legs to increase the moment of inertia of the rear half of their body so that they can rotate their front further (as much as 90°) while the rear half rotates in the opposite direction less (as little as 10°). 3.Extend their front legs and tuck their rear legs so that they can rotate their rear half further while their front half rotates in the opposite direction less.\nDepending on the cat’s flexibility and initial angular momentum, if any, the cat may need to perform steps two and three repeatedly in order to complete a full 180° rotation.\nPast works on using active spine in legged robots specialized rotation in the axis perpendicular to the saggital plane and was aimed at improving the gait. My research focusess on rotation in the axis perpendicular to the transverse plane. I developed an inertial reoreintation controller. It controls the extension and tucking in of the quadruped limbs, so that the cranial and caudal part rotates with different velocities owing to the conserved momentum. The controller thus uses the inertia of the quadruped to reorient itself.\nResults    A quadruped was modelled in the Bullet simulator and a simple state machine based controller was implemented. It works beautifully as in the following video\n  Status    As the system is verified in simulation, now it has to be implemented in hardware.

Soon, I realized it is the big name robotics conference where academia as well as industry showcase their flashy demos. Since then, for the next couple of years, I would be always looking forward the ICRA time, when there would be a swarm of updates on the most recent research happening in robotics.\nA way to attend the conference comes up    I always wished to attend these conferences, but not having an academic/research background as well as expensive registration as a non academic and expenses related to travel and accommodation held me back. I realized that there are robot competitions associated with the conference. The Humanitarian Robotics and Automation Technology Challenge (HRATC) attracted me, primarily because it related to autonomous navigation and SLAM, which was something I was exploring at my startup. Secondarily the fact that the competition used ROS as the platform and no hardware was necessary. This relieved us from the hassle and expenses of building hardware.\nSo, I teamed with two of my friends, Lentin Joseph \u0026amp; Chandykunju Alex. We named the team Autobots. The challenge involved autonomously searching and mapping an area for buried landmines using a UGV equipped with a metal detector. Teams were rewarded for detecting a landmine, marking it on the map and on the area covered. Penalties were awarded for running over landmines and crashing into obstacles/trees. Initial elimination stages involved teams competing in the Gazebo simulator. In the intermediate stage, teams were provided real data from the hardware as ROSBAG files and the code would be tested on them. The finals were scheduled to be conducted at ICRA 2016, in Stockholm. Teams would be competing on real robot hardware in the finals. To make it more realistic like an inaccessible landmine filled zone, the competition arena including the robot, landmines, obstacles etc were set up in Portugal and we were only given an initial remote access to upload our code from Stockholm. After that the robot has to operate autonomously. We cleared the initial rounds effortlessly and made into the finals. Hurray..!! So here comes my opportunity to attend ICRA. I was so excited.\nThe excitement was huge- it was my first conference, it was my first international trip, and moreover, the excitement of meeting eminent robotics researchers, attending their talks and seeing the cutting edge research happening worldwide. It was indeed a dream came true.\nThe travel, an an unexpected visit to Dubai    So, finally, its time to go to Stockholm. We borrowed money from friends and family, registered for the conference, got the visa, booked flight tickets, and decided to stay in an affordable hostel at a walkable distance from the conference venue. Our flight was from Kochi to Stockholm with a layover in Dubai. Unfortunately, the flight from Kochi got delayed and we missed our connection flight from Dubai. The airlines shifted us to an airport hotel and re-booked the next days flight for us. Even though this seemed unfortunate, we got the chance to spend a day in Dubai and do sightseeing. We visited Burj Khalifa, Palm Jumeirah etc.\nArriving in Stockholm    The next day, we arrived in Stockholm. After clearing the immigration procedures, we heard our names being called out through the PA system of the airport. We were requested to report to the airlines desk. Soon, we found out that the airlines forgot to pick our baggage from Dubai. They collected the address of our hostel and promised to deliver it next day( Which they did not until the last day of the conference). So, we are now in a foreign country, with just the dress we are in and the laptop in backpack.\nICRA EXPO    The exhibition stalls at the conference were one thing I was most looking forward to visit. I was excited to see the real robots up so close, the ones that I have seen only in YouTube videos. Moreover I got to have interesting conversations with the people exhibiting them. I met many other startup founders and could even work out some potential future collaborations. In addition, we got enough free T-shirts which came handy due to our delayed baggage.\nMeeting my heros    Another aspect was meeting those pioneers in robotics that you have only read about. These included Dr.Wolfram Burgard, Dr.Vijay Kumar from UPenn, Dr.Henrik Christensen, Dr. Oussama Khatib, Dr. Magnus Egerstedt, Dr.Melonee Wise, Dr Peter Corke, Dr. Giorgio Metta etc to name a few. I came to know them either as the professors in the MOOCs classes I took or from cool robot videos/research featured on IEEE Spectrum. Meeting them and talking with them (even though I did not had much to contribute) was a dream come true. They can be said of my role models whom I aspire to be one day. ALl of them were very friendly and approachable and we even took selfies with them. Winning the challenge    The HRATC challenge was organized over two days.We had to upload our code to the remote robot and video of the robot in operation was live streamed\nResults from the performance on two days were averaged. On the first day, out team scored the lowest. Our navigation stack primarily used GPS coordinates for localization. It was cloudy at the remote robot site and we had trouble getting an accurate GPS fix often. This caused us so much issues in navigation. After the first day, we pulled an all-nighter to re-write the navigation stack so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t use GPS always and uses a probabilistic means of localization using the noisy and slippery wheel encoders and the unreliable GPS. We performed much better the next day. But we were not much hopeful of making it to the top position, given our not that great performance on first day. The winners would only be announced on the last day of the conference. So we spend the rest of the time exploring the conference, attending talks, meeting people, etc. Exposure to Research    It was my first time seeing paper presentation sessions. There was three auditoriums where sessions were held in parallel. It was quite difficult to choose which session to attend, since many of them were interesting to me and to make things worse, they were scheduled in parallel.I was interested in everything, ranging from research on robot manipulation, flying robots, navigation, walking robots, novel hardware design and actuation, computer vision, and what not. I enjoyed almost all the sessions I attended. It was exciting to see the cutting edge research results. Moreover the basic concepts behind most of the research was simple and easy to understand. Even though I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense of many highly mathematical and purely theoretical papers, the other papers presented could be grasped easily. Even though I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make sense of many such papers due to my limited knowledge, it was an awesome learning experience. The papers published at ICRA came from all realms of robotics. Coming from a background more inclined seeing the real-hardware robots, I could classify them into two- purely theoretical/mathematical papers and papers on real robot hardware.\nPreviously my thought was that the research papers/presentations were only understood by someone with a masters or P.hD, due to the complex and advanced topics they handle. I believe keeping myself updated by not missing any IEEE spectrum video Fridays, reading voraciously every IEEE Robotics \u0026amp; Automation Magazine for the last couple of years helped me a lot in understanding them.\nI addition to getting a broad overview of all the research happening in robotics, I had a firsthand experience of how the academic research and publishing works. The sessions gave me a realization that many of the things that I did as hobby projects could be the basis for writing awesome research papers. It built in me a confidence that, I too can write and publish a research paper.\nThe interactive sessions after the paper presentations were much useful than the presentations as such as such. I could meet the authors and ask them more about their paper\nExploring Stockholm    Since this is the first international trip for the three of us, we had decided to make the best use of it. We stayed for a couple more days after the conference to explore Stockholm. Since it was May, the weather outside was awesome. The city was clean, safe and filled with greenery. We explored the city mostly on foot.\n","date":1465689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465689600,"objectID":"d1c832e3bfe6851c0c6d6806f40bd91d","permalink":"https://achuwilson.github.io/post/2016-06-12-icra16/","publishdate":"2016-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-06-12-icra16/","section":"post","summary":"Attending my first International Conference and Winning the Robotics Challenge.","tags":["robotics","conference"],"title":"Attending ICRA and winning HRATC Challenge","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Software Projects"],"content":"  What and why  How  Result  What and Why    2048 [1] is a single-player sliding block puzzle game.
