            <p>
              I am a roboticist with both an academic and industrial background. In academia, I focus my research on robot manipulation of flexible materials such as cables, using tactile sensing. On the industrial side, I have co-founded a robotics company, where I built and led R&D and production teams. I have also designed hardware and software which are in current commercial use.
            </p>
            <p>
I am currently pursuing a graduate research program at the RoboTouch Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, under Dr.Wenzhen Yuan. My research focuses on using tactile sensing to make robots learn how to manipulate flexible components such as cables.
            </p>
            <p>
Previously, I did research at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems in Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, under Dr.Bharadwaj Amrutur, where I led the joint IISc-MIT team for the Kuka Innovation AI Challenge 2021. Before IISc, I did research under Dr.Edward Adelson on building sensorized robot hands at the Perception Science Group at CSAIL MIT.
  </p>
  <p>
My skills include research, programming - real time embedded systems, computer vision, machine learning , Python/C++ application development, ROS, industrial robot programming of UR, Kuka and Motoman robots. I am also well versed with mechanical design, love iterative prototyping and enjoy getting my hands dirty in the machine shop.

                In this project we integrated tactile-guided low-level
                motion primitives with high-level vision-based task parsing for a
                the routing and assembly of cables on a reconfigurable
                 task board. A library of tactile-guided
                  motion primitives using a fingertip GelSight sensor was developed. Each primitive 
                  reliably accomplished operations such as following along a cable, wraping cable around pivots
            , weaving through slots or inserting a connector.The overall task is inferred via visual perception given
                   a goal configuration image, and then used to generate the primitive sequence.  <a href="https://youtu.be/_F0kCjBgxD0" target="_blank" > <strong style="color:green;">VIDEO </strong> </a>

                <br>
                Inspired by the capability of humans to slide an object over a surface and pivot around the corners without dropping, this project explored non-prehensile manipulation
                techniques to do the same. The MIT  Fall 2020<a href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank" > 6.881 Manipulation class</a>, which was offered entirely online, had a class project and I decided to try this. 
                The robot does not have the model of the object nor the environment. The robot maintains a constant vertical force when sliding the box over the table. At the edge, the controller is able to estimate the pose of the box
                and applies both horizontal and vertical forces to prevent slipping. The controller is also able to bring back the box from the vertical position to horizontal position on the table.

                <strong> Background Segmentation for FingerVision tactile sensor</strong>
                FingerVision is an optical tactile sensor which provides the RGB image of the object within the fingers in addition to the contact forces from the optical markers. Since the sensor captures the 
                background also in addition to the object, there exists the need to remove the background. A deep learning approach is used to segment the objects and the background. Training data is collected,
                 labelled and a U-Net based network is trained. The left part of the video shows the RGB input and the left part shows the segmented objects. The training acheives good accuracy in a couple of tens of minutes and generalizes well.

                Another personal project which provided me with lots of interesting challenges and learning oppertunities. The attempt to build a backdrivable quasi direct drive robot arm from grounds up was motivated by the easy
                availability of high torque BLDC motors, controllers and projects such as Berkeley Blue robot arm. The 7DOF robot has a spherical shoulder and a spherical wrist (not shown in video) making it dexterous. The project

                This work details the design of a novel two fin ger robot gripper with multiple Gelsight based optical-tactilesensors covering the inner surface of the hand. The multiple
                Gelsight sensors can gather the surface topology of the object
                from multiple views simultaneously as well as can track the
                shear and tensile stress. In addition, other sensing modalities
                enable the hand to gather the thermal, acoustic and vibration
                information from the object being grasped. The force controlled
                gripper is fully actuated so that it can be used for various grasp
                configurations and can also be used for in-hand manipulation
                tasks.

                We introduce a novel approach for
                  simulating a GelSight tactile sensor in the commonly used Gazebo
                  simulator. Similar to the real GelSight sensor, the simulated
                  sensor can produce high-resolution images by an optical sensor
                  from the interaction between the touched object and an opaque
                  soft membrane. It can indirectly sense forces, geometry, texture
                  and other properties of the object and enables the research of
                  Sim2Real learning with tactile sensing.

                The contact surface reconstruction capabilities of GelSight is simulated using raytracing techniques.
                An array of rays shooting from a rectangular sensor patch calculates and generates a PointCloud data of the contact surface.

                <strong>Magneto-Rheological Linear Clutch</strong>
                This paper
                  introduces a MR clutch which can control the force transmitted
                  by a linear actuator. The electromechanical model of the linear
                  clutch has been developed, implemented in hardware, and tested
                  using a prototype one Degree of Freedom arm. The design of the
                  clutch is detailed and the performance is characterized thorough
                  a series of experiments. The results suggest that the linear clutch
                  serves well for the precise force control of a linear actuator.

                  This project, which was done as a part of the CMU-24787 AI&ML class explored various ML techniques 
                  to learn and classify different cable types from the tactile data. The tactile data was captured from GelSight sensors when 
                  the robot grasped a cable and executed a predefined push primitive action. The classification performance of numerous
                   shallow machine learning approaches was compared against that of a CNN. We also implemented
                  PCA to investigate how these methods change with lower dimensional data.
