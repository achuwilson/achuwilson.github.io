abstract = " This paper proposes a Magneto Rheological linear clutch  for  use  in  human  safe  robotic  applications.  The  force  transmitted to the links of the robot must be precisely controlled for  any  manipulator  if  it  has  to  be  operated  safely  alongside  humans.  The  traditional  approaches  to  this  problem  is  using  various    compliant    actuating    schemes    like    Series    Elastic    Actuators,  Joint  Torque  Control  etc.  Research  on  the  usage  of  smart  materials  that  change  their  properties  on  application  of  electrical or magnetic fields for human safe robots have gained momentum  recently.  Studies  on  the  feasibility  of  Magneto-Rheological   actuators   has   been   done   already.   This   paper   introduces a MR clutch which can control the force transmitted by a linear actuator. The electromechanical model of the linear clutch has been developed, implemented in hardware, and tested using a prototype one Degree of Freedom arm. The design of the clutch is detailed and the performance is characterized thorough a series of experiments. The results suggest that the linear clutch serves well for the precise force control of a linear actuator"
