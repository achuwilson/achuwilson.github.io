abstract = "This work explores a modular gripper with tactile sensing capabilities all-round the surface and not just limited to the inner fingertip. The system makes use of commonly available components to achieve optical tactile sensing by detecting deformations on a soft transparent silicone elastomer skin. Whole body tactile sensing around the gripper not only provides information on the object being grasped, but also of the immediate environment. These contact information can aid in the exploration of unstructured and cluttered environment"
