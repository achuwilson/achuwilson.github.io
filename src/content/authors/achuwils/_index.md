<DIV align="justify">

I am a roboticist, currently working at [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bangalore, under [Dr.Bharadwaj Amrutur](https://aml.ece.iisc.ac.in/index.php/Bharadwaj_Amrutur). My research interests involve robot manipulation and tactile sensing. Over the years working in industry, startups and academia, I have gained experience building mechanical systems, designing electronics, writing code and managing teams. 

Prior to joining IISc I worked under [Dr.Edward Adelson](http://persci.mit.edu/people/adelson) at the Perception Science Group at CSAIL MIT . 

I am also one of the co-founders and was the CTO of [Sastra Robotics](https://sastrarobotics.com/).  Sastra builds robots to automate the functional testing of devices: ranging from smartphones to cockpit avionic panels. Later I stepped down, as the startup matured, to pursue a career in academia. Since then, I also serve as a technical consultant for Sastra.
