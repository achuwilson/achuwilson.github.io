<DIV align="justify">

I am a roboticist with both an academic and industrial background. In academia, I focus my research on robot manipulation, tactile sensing and machine learning, whereas on the industrial side, I have co-founded a robotics company, led and managed R&D and production teams, designed hardware and software in current commercial use.

I am currently pursuing graduate school and does research under [Dr.Wenzhen Yuan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/wenzhen-yuan/) at the RoboTouch Lab at Carnegie Mellon University on manipulating flexible components such as cables using tactile sensing for industrial assembly tasks.


Previously I did research at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) in [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bangalore, under [Dr.Bharadwaj Amrutur](https://aml.ece.iisc.ac.in/index.php/Bharadwaj_Amrutur), where I led the joint IISc-MIT team for the Kuka Innovation AI Challenge 2021. Prior to IISc, I worked under [Dr.Edward Adelson](http://persci.mit.edu/people/adelson) at the Perception Science Group at CSAIL MIT.



My skills include research, programming - real time embedded systems, computer vision, machine learning , Python/C++ application development, ROS, industrial robot programming of UR and Kuka robots. I am also well versed with mechanical design, love iterative prototyping and enjoy getting my hands dirty in the machine shop.


When I am not working on robots, I would be spending time reading, biking or exploring new places, nature or cuisines.
