I am a roboticist with both an academic and industrial background. My current interests are  in dexterous and non-prehensile robot manipulation, reinforcement learning and tactile sensing.
- ##### Academia
  - **Carnegie Mellon University**, *Robotouch Lab, RI*
    - Advisor: Dr.Wenzhen Yuan
    - Project : Tactile driven manipulation primitives for cable routing  and assembly
  - **Indian Institute of Science**, *RBCCPS*
    - Advisors: Dr Bharadwaj Amrutur
    - Led the team comprised of IISc and MIT researchers on the Kuka Innovation Award - AI challenge. We became one of the 5 finalists worldwide.
    - Developed a dexterous tactile gripper which is capable of in hand object rolling.
  - **Massachussets Institute of Technology**. *Persci Lab, CSAIL*
    - Advisor: Dr. Edward Adelson
    - Developed a fully actuated gripper with multiple GelSight sensors and other sensing modalities.
- ##### Industry
  - **Sastra Robotics**
    - Co-founding C.T.O
    -  Developed robot manipulators from grounds up for device testing applications
    -  Reduced device testing times of clients by upto 70
    -  Built and managed a technical team of 20 engineers.
  - **Asimov Robotics (Energid Technolgies)**
    - Developed ROS and LabVIEW interfaces for robot manipulators.
    - Developed manipulation pipeline for a bimanual robot
