<DIV align="justify">

I am a roboticist with both an academic and industrial background. In  academia, I focus my research on robot manipulation of flexible materials such as cables, using tactile sensing.  On the industrial side, I have co-founded a  robotics company, where I built and led R&D and  production teams. I have also designed hardware and software which are  in current commercial use.

I am currently pursuing a graduate research program at the RoboTouch Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, under [Dr.Wenzhen Yuan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/wenzhen-yuan/). My research focuses on using tactile sensing to make robots learn how to manipulate flexible components such as cables.

Previously, I did research at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) in [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bangalore, under [Dr.Bharadwaj Amrutur](https://aml.ece.iisc.ac.in/index.php/Bharadwaj_Amrutur), where I led the joint IISc-MIT team for the Kuka Innovation AI Challenge 2021. Before IISc, I did research under [Dr.Edward Adelson](http://persci.mit.edu/people/adelson) on building sensorized robot hands at the Perception Science Group at CSAIL MIT.

My skills include research, programming - real time embedded systems, computer vision, machine learning , Python/C++ application development, ROS, industrial robot programming of UR and Kuka robots. I am also well versed with mechanical design, love iterative prototyping and enjoy getting my hands dirty in the machine shop.

When I am not working on robots, I enjoy reading, biking , cooking or exploring new places or nature.
