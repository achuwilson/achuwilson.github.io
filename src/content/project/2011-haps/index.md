## What and Why
This is my undergraduate college project. 

A high altitude platfrom based communication system, which can be rapidly deployed using a balloon is designed and implemented. It is similar to the Project Loon by Google, which was later announced. 

This page will be updated later as time permits and more details are [here](https://achuwilson.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/long-range-rf-link-using-nrf24l01-rf-transceiver/)

## Results

We could not deploy it on a real weather balloon as we were constrained by resources. Instead, the developed system was fixed at the top of a high rise building and we were able to make long distance communication beyond line of sight, using the system as a transponder.

In addition, we won the **Best Project Award** from the college for the year of 2012.
