1. [What and why](#what-and-why)



## What and Why

Chippu was a small social robot made as a side project. It could understand speech commands, make conversations, recocnize faces and navigate on his own using SLAM and help me with my emails and calender, like an assistant. All the functionalities was implemented using the publically available packages in ROS. This was an attempt to learn and get familiar with ROS by building something.


Here are some of the videos of chippu.
