## What and Why
This was a small project done for the qualification round of MBZIRC Challenge 2015. The drone would lift off, move in a circular pattern with incrasing readius and searching for the marker using the downward facing camera. Once the marker is localized, a simple path planner is used to plan the trajectory to land the drone on the rover.



## Results

Even though we didnt make it to the finals, it was a good learning experience.

Here is a video of it.
