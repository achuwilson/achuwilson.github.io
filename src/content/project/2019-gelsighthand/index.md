## What and Why

This  work  details  the  design  of  a  novel  two  fin-ger  robot  gripper  with  multiple  Gelsight  based  optical-tactilesensors  covering  the  inner  surface  of  the  hand.  The  multipleGelsight  sensors  can  gather  the  surface  topology  of  the  objectfrom  multiple  views  simultaneously  as  well  as  can  track  theshear  and  tensile  stress.  In  addition,  other  sensing  modalitiesenable  the  hand  to  gather  the  thermal,  acoustic  and  vibrationinformation from the object being grasped. The force controlledgripper is fully actuated so that it can be used for various graspconfigurations  and  can  also  be  used  for  in-hand  manipulationtasks.  Here  we  present  the  design  of  such  a  gripper.
