## What and Why

PulleyDrive is a side project exploring speed reduction/torque amplification using the principle of pulleys. This project was supported by the "ProjXpo" program under MIT Innovation Initiative.

## Previous Works

This work was mainly inspired by the cable-pulley based actuation of the Ambidex robot [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8016639)

## What makes it special
1. Zero Backlash
2. LightWeight
3. High Stiffness
4. Not Expensive


## Status
The following video shows a prototype in operation.
